first_article_description:
  The proprietor of Cloud Tech.PH is Melvin Mallari, and he co-owns the
  company with his wife, Shinelle Ann Mallari. His line of work is online
  retail business marketing. They launched their company in the midst of a
  pandemic during the final quarter of 2020. They were offering gloves for
  bicycles back then. They purchased the supplies for their gloves in
  China and sold them on Facebook. After that, they started selling
  everyday items including shoes, clothing, sunglasses, watches, and a
  variety of other things. In actuality, their general product sales
  business has endured longer than their bicycle glove sales operation.
  They are currently selling their goods online and on a variety of
  platforms, including Facebook, Shopee, Lazada, and Tiktok. In June 2023,
  they introduced a brand-new product called Cone Bite Delight. It is a
  chocolate-filled ice cream cone. Since they don't yet have a physical
  store, they continue to sell online. Its firm is currently doing quite
  well, but throughout its three years of operation, things haven't always
  gone as planned. They alternate between being at the top and the bottom.
  However, that's how business is; there will always be something standing
  in your way of success. Do not let negative events ruin your business;
  instead, keep going and focus on the things that will help it grow.
